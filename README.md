## Banker's_Algorithm

This project implements the **Banker's Algorithm** in C++ to determine if a system is in a **safe state** based on current resource allocation.

It reads from an input file ('input.txt'), calculates the "Need" matrix, and checks whether a safe sequence exists for the processes.
