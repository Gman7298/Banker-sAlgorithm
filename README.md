## Banker's_Algorithm

This project implements the **Banker's Algorithm** in C++ to determine if a system is in a **safe state** based on current resource allocation.

It reads from an input file ('input.txt'), calculates the "Need" matrix, and checks whether a safe sequence exists for the processes.


## Files
- 'bankers_algorithm.cpp' — Main C++ source file.
- 'input.txt' — Example input file containing available resources, allocation, and max demand matrices.
- 'README.md' — Project explanation.
- 'output.txt' — Sample output file.


## How to Compile and Run
g++ bankers.cpp -o bankers
./bankers
