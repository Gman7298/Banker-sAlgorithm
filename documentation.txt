##Purpose
  To check if the system is in a safe state

##How it works
  1) Read available resources, allocation, and maximum demand matrices from 'input.txt'.
  2) Calculate the 'Need' matrix by subtracting allocation from maximum demand.
  3) Check if there is a safe sequence.
    -Find an unfinished process whose needs can be satisfied by the available resources.
    -Pretend to allocate needed resources to that process.
    -Mark the process as finished.
  4) Repeat until all processes are finished (safe state), or no process can be made (unsafe state).

  ##Error Handling
  1) If 'input.txt' does not open, the program prints an error and exits.
  2) If no safe sequence is found, the system is declared unsafe.
